    "computerized system designed for the storage, retrieval, and analyis of geographically referenced data.\n",

    "- G: Geographic - Where\n",
    "- I: Information - What, data attached to the where\n",

    "- Points\n",
    "- Lines\n",
    "- Polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "And it can be represented in two ways:\n",
    "- **Vector**: series of x,y coordinates, discrete data, represented in vertices, smaller file size. Ex: points, lines, polygons and TINs (Triangulated Irregular Networks = vector-based representation of the physical land surface or sea bottom, the basic unit is a triangle)\n",
    "- **Raster**: pixels, continuous data, represented in cells or grid, larger file size. Ex: elevation, slope...\n",
    "    - Continuous data: data that can take any value within a range. Ex: temperature, elevation, precipitation\n",
    "    - Discrete data: data that can take only specific values. Ex: land use, soil type, vegetation type\n",
    "\n",
    "    Measured by cell size dimensions (resolution) and number of cells (extent)\n",
    "        - **Values applies to the center point of the cell**. For certain types of data, the cell value represents a measured value at the center point of the cell.\n",
    "        - **Values applies to the whole area of the cell**. For certain types of data, the cell value represents an average value for the whole area of the cell.\n",

    "Relationship between the size of an object on a map and the size of the actual object on the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "1:1000000 means that 1 unit on the map is equivalent to 1,000,000 units on the ground. (1 cm = 10 km)\n",

    "- **sf**: Simple Features, core package for handling vector data (points, lines, polygons) in a simple, efficient way.\n",
    "- **sp**: Older but still widely used, package for spatial data manipulation and modeling.\n",
    "- **raster**: For handling raster datasets, such as satellite images or digital elevation models (DEMs).\n",
    "- **terra**: Newer package for handling raster and vector data, with a focus on large datasets and high-performance computing.\n",
    "- **tmap**: For creating static and interactive maps.\n",
    "- **ggplot2**: For creating advanced maps, static maps with the grammar of graphics.\n",
    "- **leaflet**: For creating interactive web maps.\n",
    "- **mapview**: For interactive maps in RStudio viewer or web browser.\n",
